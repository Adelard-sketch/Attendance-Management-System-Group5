# Attendance-Management-System-Group5
Welcome to our project! The Attendance Management System is developed by Ashesi University students to efficiently track and manage attendance. It provides an easy-to-use platform for recording, monitoring, and analyzing attendance data.

ðŸ“Œ Problem
At the start of the semester, the Dean requested a new Attendance Management System. The problem is that there is no standardized or accessible way for students, faculty, and interns to log in or register. This creates challenges for usability, security, and record-keeping.

ðŸ“Œ Solution
Our solution is a modern, web-based login and registration interface. The prototype captures full name, email, password, and role (Faculty, Intern, or Student). It follows accessibility standards, with labels, ARIA attributes, and built-in HTML5 validation. Password checks and error handling are also included to improve security and ease of use.

ðŸ“Œ Technologies in the Prototype

The prototype was built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
HTML5 â†’ structure and validation.
CSS3 â†’ professional, responsive design.
JavaScript â†’ interactivity, toggling forms, password checks.
WAI-ARIA â†’ accessibility for screen readers.
Backend Frameworks â†’ Node.js, Django, or Spring Boot.
Database â†’ PostgreSQL or MySQL with secure password storage.
Security Features â†’ HTTPS, hashing, session management, MFA.
Deployment â†’ Ashesi servers or cloud (AWS, Azure).

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

By the end of this project, the team should be able to:
Understand the need for secure and accessible login and registration forms in university systems.
Apply HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to design modern, user-friendly web interfaces.
Implement accessibility best practices using labels, ARIA attributes, and validation features.
Recognize the additional technologies needed to move from prototype to a full system (backend, database, and security).
Appreciate how design decisions affect usability, security, and compliance.
